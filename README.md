# OAuthable

Most APIs these days require OAuth to authenticate to use them. This can
often become a real pain to setup. OAuthable helps you setup, test, and
implement the OAuth connections to over 70 different APIs.

## Usage

You can simply use OAuthable.com to setup and test your APIs.

If you'd like to deploy OAuthable to your own server, you can easily
deploy this to Heroku.
